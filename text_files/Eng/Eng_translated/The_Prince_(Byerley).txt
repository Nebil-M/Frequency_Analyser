THOSE who are solicitous of acquiring the favour of a prince, generally present him with whatever they possess that is most rare, curious, or valuable; as horses, arms, precious stones, &c. of a value commensurate with the dignity of the personage to whom they pay homage. For my part, my anxiety to present myself before you, with the best proof of my devotion, has not enabled me to discover, amongst all I possess, any thing that I esteem more, or account so valuable, as a knowledge of the actions of celebrated men; a knowledge acquired by a long experience of modern times, and by an assiduous perusal of the ancients. The observations which I made with all the accuracy, reflection, and care of which I was capable, are contained in the small volume which I now address to you; not because I conceive it worth your acceptance, but because I am persuaded that your goodness will not refuse the offering; inasmuch as it was out of my power to present you with any thing more interesting than a work which will enable you to attain, in a short period, all the experience that I acquired in the space of many years continual meditation and sufferings in the school of adversity.

You will not find in this fragment either a glowing or lofty style, nor indeed any of those vain ornaments with which authors seek to embellish their works. If mine has the good fortune to interest you, it will be only from the importance of the subject, or, possibly, also by the solidity of the reflections, as well as by the truth of the facts which are therein related.

It will, perhaps, appear temerity in me (a man of obscure birth) to dare give rules of conduct to those who govern; but as the painter, when about to sketch a mountainous country, places himself on the plain, and ascends an eminence to draw the landscape of a vale, even so I conceive that a person must be a prince to know the nature and character of a people, and a plebeian to know that of princes.

I am therefore, bold enough to hope that you will accept this feeble tribute in favour of the intention with which it is offered; and you will do justice to the ardent desire I feel to see you fill with glory those high destinies, to which fortune and your splendid talents have called you. If you from your elevated rank, deign to look on me, and on the persecutions of which I am the victim, you will convince yourself of my innocence and the injustice of my enemies.

NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI.





↑ He was the father of Catherine de Medicis, Queen of France, and died in 1519.
